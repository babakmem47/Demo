** Problem: navbar dropdown not collapsing!

## Solution: The cause of this problem is I didn't replace 'jquery' with 'lib' in BundleConfig after consolidating!


** Problem: CascadeDelete:true not change to false after add-migration even when I set .WillCascadeOnDelete(false);   
	// I notice that other annotation like Maxlength or nullable: false for string are not apply 
	to configuration after execute Add-Migration -Force

## Solution: Forget to Add Definition of IpRangeConfiguration.cs and SetadConfiguration.cs to onModelCreating 
method of ADBC
